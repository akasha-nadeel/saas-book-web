/*
 * Vendored from itshover (https://itshover.com, Apache-2.0) rather than pulled
 * with `shadcn add`: this repo has no `components.json`, and `shadcn init`
 * would rewrite `globals.css` with shadcn's own token set over the `@theme`
 * block the whole app is coloured from. The components use hooks and carry no
 * directive of their own, so one is added above.
 *
 * **One behaviour is edited: every animation callback returns early on an empty
 * scope.** Motion fires a hover-end on an element that is unmounting, and
 * `animate` against a scope whose ref has already been cleared throws
 * `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelectorAll')`. Hovering a rail
 * icon and then hiding the rail — entering focus mode, or leaving the editor —
 * is all it takes. Nothing here can catch it from outside, since the throw is
 * inside motion's own callback.
